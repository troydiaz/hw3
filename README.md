# Fuzzing and Delta Debugging for Sorting Program

## **Build and Test Instructions**

### **1. Compile the Sorting Program**
To clean previous build artifacts and compile the `mysort.c` program, run:

```sh
make clean && make
```

### **2. Run Delta Debugging**
Use the delta debugging tool to minimize a failing test case:

```sh
chmod +x script
```

```sh
delta/bin/delta -test=script -cp_minimal=min_failing_test.txt < big_failing_test.txt
```

- **`script`**: A test script that verifies if a test case still triggers a failure.
- **`big_failing_test.txt`**: A large failing test case generated by fuzzing.
- **`min_failing_test.txt`**: The minimized failing test case output by delta debugging.

### **3. Test the Sorting Program**
To test the `mysort` program with an input test file and a timeout, use:

```sh
./mysort <input.txt> <seconds>
```

- **`<input.txt>`**: A file containing integers (one per line) to be sorted.
- **`<seconds>`**: The maximum allowed execution time before timeout.

Ensure that the timeout is sufficiently large (e.g., 2-4 seconds) to account for execution delays but not excessively high to slow down debugging and fuzzing.

## Extra

### **Compile fixed version of mysort.c:**

```sh
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o fixed_mysort fixed_mysort.c
```

### **Run fixed version:**
```sh
./fixed_mysort <input_file.txt> <timeout>
```
